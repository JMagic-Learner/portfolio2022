## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Portfolio.
              
Description:
This portfolio showcases my skillsets and professional history. This portfolio was originally designed via HTML,CSS, and Javascript. Over time, I transitioned to REACT, Express, MongoDb as my core processes behind this project. I utlize MUI-React as my front end UI styling. MUI allows me to use readily built components to format my Portfolio. For server side application, i rely on GraphQL and Apollo-Server, to help relay queries, mutations. The json Data is seeded remotely to MongoDB via MongoDb Tools.             
          
Coding Process
Given that I've done a few portfolio applications before, I wanted to incorporate a "cleaner" simplistic design. I wanted to ask myself what would an employer would want to see within a few clicks on the front page. I decided on a few main facets of my webpage. An BIO, RESUME, PROJECT, CONTACT page would be required. I used a huge mainstay from ZENITHHIGHLIGHT, which is in a sense a precursor to this application. The main UI layout mimics Portfolio, however the MUI-react dependencies are updated to Node 16. The first process in this application was updating all dependencies to the lastest version. That also meant switching coding terminlogy and syntax in this update. Believe it or not, this is actaully attempt (3) of deploying a HEROKU based portfolio. The first had working local code, but couldnt deploy to HEROKU due to serverside errors, memory (JAVASCRIPT error) or ECONREFUSED (MongoDB connection error). The key fault in this first iteration of my code was that I tried to deploy both client (FRONTEND) and server (BACKEND) code immediately without seeing if HEROKU can correctly deploy. THe second iteration was a upgrade on all dependencies that were carried over from the ZENITHHIGHLIGHT project. This proved to be a mistake, as updating boardwide turned into deprecated relationships between things like React-Router-Dom, and other syntax depended Node modules. This third attempt follows this approach. 1.) Develop Frontend, 2.) Refine UI in Frontend 3.) Port over / convert SERVER code from previous two iterations.
