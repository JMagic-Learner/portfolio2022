            <Typography > Starting in 2009 , my father and I began to flip real estate. In addition to my academic studies at FWPA, I had the opportunity to
              experience and help my family in a little venture called Greenville Properties LLC. Since then, I studied Real Estate and obtained a WA Real Estate Broker License.
              I am currently an Windermere REALTOR, aiming to incorporate the Zillow API with my real estate background.
